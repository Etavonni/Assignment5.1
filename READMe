Summary of findings:
--------------------
Drivers who visit bars more often are more likely to accept bar coupons.
Similarly, drivers who visit coffee houses more frequently will accept coffee house coupons.

Whether the driver is less than 25 years of age has negligible impact on acceptance rates. There is no major impact of having a kid as a passanger on acceptance rate. There is no major impact of occupation in farming, fishing or forestry on acceptance rates.
